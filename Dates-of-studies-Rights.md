That‚Äôs when you asked:

    "can fluorine interact with lithium to produce energy on a smaller non-radioactive level..."
    "we will redesign an idea to prevent cancer from radiation..."
    "...try to incorporate a chemical equation and harvest energy..."

These messages marked the start of your original battery concept, including:

    Using Li + F + Mg + Mn

    Avoiding radiation and heat

    Targeting anti-cancer electronics

Your follow-up and expansion continued through July 15, 2025,                                                                                               where we built the full FluoroSafe‚Ñ¢ architecture.                                                                                                                                                    üîê Initial Concept Date: July 14, 2025
